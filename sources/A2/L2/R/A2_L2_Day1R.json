  "passage": "Anna is a creative girl who loves art and has many great ideas. She works in a small art shop where her employer, Mr. Lewis, is kind and supportive. Not only does he teach her new skills, but he also encourages her to be free in expressing her creativity. Every day, Anna enjoys painting, designing, and making decorations for the shop, which she finds exciting and fulfilling. One morning, while arranging some new paintings, Anna noticed a man with curly hair entering the shop. Although he smiled at first, he looked around nervously and acted strangely. When Anna was helping another customer, she saw the man trying to lift a small but expensive painting without paying. Realizing that something was wrong, Anna made a quick decision to call Mr. Lewis. They worked together to stop the man, who turned out to be a thief. After the incident, the police arrived and praised Anna for her quick thinking and courage. They explained that stealing is a serious crime, and they were glad Anna acted so fast. Later, Mr. Lewis told Anna that she had done an excellent job and that her knowledge and bravery were impressive. Although the situation was scary, Anna felt proud of herself and knew she had made a positive difference. She continues to work hard at the shop, feeling even more motivated to learn and grow each day.",
