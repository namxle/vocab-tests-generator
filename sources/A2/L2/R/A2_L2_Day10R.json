  "passage": "Yesterday, I decided to spend a whole day without my phone. It was not an easy choice, but I wanted to see how it would differ from my usual routine. Normally, I depend on my phone for everything—checking the weather, chatting with friends, and even reading the latest news about my favorite celebrity. Without my phone, I started the day with a book. It was a work of fiction about a boy who climbs a high mountain to find treasure. Reading was a good way to relax, and I found it very helpful to focus on something other than screens. Later, I went for a walk in the park. I noticed small features of nature, like the colorful leaves and the sound of birds, which I usually miss. In the afternoon, I helped my mom bake a cake. We laughed when we accidentally added too much butter, making it a little too fat! At the end of the day, I realized that while phones are helpful, it’s good to take a break sometimes and enjoy life offline.",
