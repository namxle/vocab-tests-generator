    "passage": "Architecture is a way to express ideas and culture. In different regions of the world, buildings often have unique shapes and designs, which reflect the traditions of their people. For example, in Egypt, the pyramids are shaped like triangles and are signs of the pharaohs’ power and greatness. In Japan, people often build houses with wooden structures that can move slightly during earthquakes, which shows a strong sense of safety and preparation. Sometimes, buildings are created to celebrate important events or achievements. The Eiffel Tower in France, which was built during a world fair, marks the birth of modern engineering and has become a global symbol of innovation. Architects often suggest ideas that are both creative and practical, aiming to meet the needs of the people who will use their buildings. For instance, they might design a school where children can learn towards a brighter future, or a hospital that brings comfort to patients while also being energy-efficient. Many architects wish to create places where people feel happy, safe, and inspired. When you look at a building, it feels like it has its own voice, telling the story of why it was built and who it was built for. This is why architecture is so important; it connects us to the past, the present, and the future.",
