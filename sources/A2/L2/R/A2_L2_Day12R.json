  "passage": "Last weekend, my family and I went on a picnic by the coast. The weather was perfect, and we brought everything we needed to stay comfortable. We packed blankets, food, and even a small bottle of soap to wash our hands before eating. When we arrived, we found a spot near the water where the waves were calm and peaceful. While exploring the area, we saw some wild animals, including birds and small crabs. My dad reminded us to protect nature by not leaving any trash behind. He said pollution can destroy the beautiful environment and harm animals. We also used bug spray to keep insects away and avoid any bites that could spread disease. During lunch, we enjoyed sandwiches and fresh fruit while listening to the sound of the waves. It was a relaxing and fun day, and we promised to take care of the coast so future picnics could be just as enjoyable.",
