  "passage": "School clubs and activities are a great way for students to learn new skills and have fun. At my school, many clubs exist, and they offer something for everyone. For example, the Eco Club teaches students how to recycle and reduce waste. They placed recycling bins around the school to collect items like paper and plastic. The Art Club helps students look at the world creatively by teaching them how to draw and paint. In the Cooking Club, we learn how to bake cakes and cook meals. Last week, we used the school oven to bake cookies, and everyone enjoyed them. The Debate Club focuses on improving speaking skills and confidence. Members of this club practice debating topics, such as whether schools should contain more outdoor activities. There is even a Travel Club that dreams about visiting places, including how airlines work to bring people to exciting destinations. School clubs not only make learning fun but also help students make friends and explore their interests.",
