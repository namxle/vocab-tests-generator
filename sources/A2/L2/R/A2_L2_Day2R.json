  "passage": "Many ancient buildings around the world show how creative and skilled architects were in the past. For example, the Great Pyramid of Giza, which is located in Egypt, has stood for thousands of years and remains one of the wonders of the ancient world. It has a narrow entrance that leads to many hidden rooms, which were carefully designed to protect treasures. The architects had to manage the construction with great care, as they did not have modern tools to help them. At the top of the pyramid, there was once a shiny stone that reflected sunlight so brightly that it could be seen from far away. In ancient Greece, architects built the Parthenon, which is a temple dedicated to the goddess Athena. This temple was constructed on a high level of ground to show its importance, and its design included many details that symbolized strength and beauty. Since there were no trucks or cranes in ancient times, materials like stone had to be sailed across the sea, and workers had to lift heavy blocks using simple tools. Unlike modern architects, who sometimes get ideas from novels, ancient architects focused on making buildings that were strong and long-lasting. These incredible structures teach us about the creativity and intelligence of ancient people, whose designs continue to inspire us today.",
