  "passage": "Last Saturday, my family and I went to the zoo. At the entrance, we had to check our tickets before going inside. We were surprised to see a big advertising board with a map of all the animal enclosures. Our first stop was the underground reptile house, where we saw snakes and lizards. My younger brother loved the lion exhibit the most, while I enjoyed watching the elephants. We noticed that the zoo had set up special bins for rubbish to keep the area clean. They even had a sign asking visitors to refuse plastic bags and use eco-friendly options instead. Near the food court, a survey was being conducted to ask visitors about their favorite animals. The zookeepers also showed us how they wash and feed the animals every day. Before leaving, we visited the gift shop, where my mom paid in cash for a T-shirt with a tiger design. My dad, on the other hand, decided to buy a book about animals using his credit card. As we walked back to the car, my brother got to ride in a stroller with big wheels because he was tired. It was a fun and educational day for all of us.",
