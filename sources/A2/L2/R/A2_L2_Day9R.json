  "passage": "Last summer, I had a dream vacation with my family. We decided to visit a small island that is not a typical tourist destination. The island was quiet and peaceful, and we felt safe exploring its beaches and forests. The hotel we chose had a friendly owner who welcomed us warmly. It wasn’t a luxury hotel, but it met all the standard needs for a comfortable stay. Every morning, we enjoyed a regular breakfast of fresh fruit and bread while sitting quietly by the sea. One of the highlights of the trip was kayaking. We paddled among the calm, blue waters, surrounded by beautiful fish and coral. In the evenings, we talked about our day and felt satisfied with all the fun and relaxation. My favorite part was meeting a group of tourists from the United States. They shared stories about their home, and we exchanged ideas about the best travel destinations. This vacation showed me how wonderful it is to connect with nature and people from different places.",
