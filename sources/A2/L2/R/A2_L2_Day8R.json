  "passage": "Emily is a teenager who enjoys a busy but exciting life. Every morning, she wakes up early to prepare for school. Emily is very clever and always finishes her homework on time. At school, she loves her science class the most because she can identify how things work in the natural world. During lunch, Emily spends time with her friends. They prefer an informal setting, so they often sit under a lovely tree in the schoolyard. After school, Emily likes to relax a little. She sometimes feels lazy, but she knows she needs to complete her chores. In the evening, Emily helps her mother with cooking. They talk about the day while preparing a meal with fresh material from the garden. Emily also enjoys reading books. Her favorite stories are about characters who are brave and clever. On weekends, Emily is likely to meet her friends at the park. They talk, laugh, and imagine their futures. Emily dreams of becoming a doctor, while her best friend plans to marry and travel the world. No matter what they choose, they believe even the least exciting days can be special if spent with people they love.",
