  "passage": "A strong community is built when people work together and support each other, which creates trust and unity. Local events, such as festivals, clean-up days, or school plays (dramas), provide opportunities for neighbors to gather and strengthen their relationships. For instance, a community drama held in a park or school hall can help neighbors express themselves creatively while also bringing people closer. If a neighbor needs help repairing their home, others in the community might offer support by lending tools or sharing skills, which fosters cooperation. Nearby departments, like the fire department, are always available to assist during emergencies, whether it’s putting out fires or rescuing pets, ensuring that the community remains safe. Even when most people are asleep, doctors and police officers work to protect others and address urgent needs. A bridge connecting two neighborhoods can symbolize unity, as it allows people to visit each other and share resources easily. Distance does not always separate people in a strong community, as neighbors can stay connected through phone calls or social media. Local libraries, schools, and parks also play key roles as spaces where people can gather, share resources, and organize activities. By showing kindness and working together, communities can become places where everyone feels welcome, supported, and encouraged to contribute to the greater good.",
