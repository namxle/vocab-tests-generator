  "passage": "Developing independence and positive habits is essential for personal growth, especially during important stages of life. Schools and training programs often play a key role in teaching young people how to take responsibility for their actions, which prepares them for future challenges. For instance, a student might learn how to manage their time better during a busy school season by creating a study schedule and sticking to it, even when distractions arise. While some lessons may seem serious, they provide a strong foundation for becoming an independent adult who can make thoughtful decisions. Sometimes, a visit to a train station, where platforms are bustling with activity, serves as a reminder of how important it is to stay organized and calm in busy environments. A unit on teamwork might teach students how to collaborate peacefully, even when opinions differ, which is a skill they can use in both personal and professional settings. Although building good habits can be challenging, there is always hope for success if people stay focused and consistent, regardless of setbacks. Whether it’s learning to balance schoolwork and free time or preparing for a new job, positive habits and independence are valuable skills that lead to long-term growth and opportunities.",
