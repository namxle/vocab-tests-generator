  "passage": "Learning a new language can be both fun and challenging. When you start, you should consider what you want to achieve. Do you want to perform well in a test, speak with others, or understand a new culture? For example, English is spoken in many countries, but each region has its own dialect and accent. A dialect includes special words and grammar, while an accent is how the words sound when spoken. In class, our teacher showed us a photograph of people talking in different countries and explained how they use English in unique ways. She also gave us a printed list of common phrases used in daily life. Suddenly, a student asked, 'What if I can’t speak perfectly?' The teacher smiled and said, 'It’s okay. Just try, and you will improve step by step.' Learning a language is not only about grammar but also about enjoying the process.",
