  "passage": "Living in a big city has its challenges and rewards. Cities are often filled with skyscrapers, tall buildings that seem to touch the sky. These buildings allow many people to live and work in a small area, but they can also lead to heavy traffic on the streets. To avoid long delays, some people prefer to take the train instead of driving their cars. Using public transportation can make travel easier and better for the environment. Parking is another common problem in cities. Finding a space can take a lot of time, especially near busy areas. To deal with this issue, some cities have built parking garages to make life more convenient for drivers. However, many people believe that walking or biking is a better option to avoid traffic altogether. City life also shapes people’s behaviour. In busy environments, people often need to act quickly and think ahead to save time. Despite the challenges, city living offers opportunities and unique experiences that many people enjoy.",
