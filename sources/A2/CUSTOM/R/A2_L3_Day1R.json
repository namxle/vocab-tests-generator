  "passage": "Fashion plays a big role in how people express themselves, and shopping is one of the best ways to explore new trends. During holiday seasons, stores often have large sales so that customers can buy fashionable items at lower prices. This makes it easier for people to purchase gifts, such as jewellery, which is both elegant and long-lasting. Although some items can still be expensive, many shops offer credit options, allowing customers to pay gradually. If you visit a fashion store during a sale, you might notice lorries delivering new stock to ensure shelves are always full. Shopping is more enjoyable when friends or family join because they can give advice and share opinions about different items. When shopping for a sale, it is important to remember your wallet so you can pay for your chosen pieces. While sales make shopping affordable, they also help people explore new fashion styles and feel good about their choices.",
