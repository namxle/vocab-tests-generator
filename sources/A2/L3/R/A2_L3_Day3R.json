  "passage": "Posters are an effective way to share information because they can communicate quickly and clearly, especially in emergencies. For example, during a natural disaster, posters are used to inform people about evacuation routes and safety measures so that lives can be saved. However, if a poster has low-quality printing or unclear text, it might fail to deliver its message effectively, which could cause confusion or even panic. In such cases, organizations may request new designs to replace the old ones, ensuring that the information is easy to understand. Reports, on the other hand, provide more detailed information about a situation. After a disaster, teams often write reports to explain what caused the event and how to prevent similar situations in the future. These reports might include a sheet with data about the damage, such as the number of homes affected or the resources needed for recovery. Vans are often used to deliver both posters and reports to areas where communication is urgently needed so that people can receive the information in time. Although posters are useful for spreading basic information, reports offer a deeper understanding, which is essential for making long-term plans and avoiding future problems.",
