  "passage": "Advertisements play an important role in helping people decide what to buy, as they often provide useful information about products. Many stores advertise their products online or on TV so that they can reach more customers. For example, a furniture store might show a flat full of stylish chairs, tables, and sofas to make their products look appealing. A helpful tip for shopping is to always compare prices because one store might sell the same item for less money, which could save you every penny. In some cases, advertisements include special discounts, but you should read them carefully to understand all the details. When buying clothes, it is important to check the buttons and seams so that you can be sure they are well-made. For home appliances, such as a washing machine, read the advertisement carefully to see if the price includes delivery and installation, as these services are not always free. Shopping smart means looking at details and thinking about what you really need, even when the advertisement is very convincing. Although advertisements can be helpful, they may sometimes exaggerate the benefits of a product, which means you should not believe everything you see.",
