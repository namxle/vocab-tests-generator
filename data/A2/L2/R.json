      "passage": "Anna is a creative girl who loves art and has many great ideas. She works in a small art shop where her employer, Mr. Lewis, is kind and supportive. Not only does he teach her new skills, but he also encourages her to be free in expressing her creativity. Every day, Anna enjoys painting, designing, and making decorations for the shop, which she finds exciting and fulfilling. One morning, while arranging some new paintings, Anna noticed a man with curly hair entering the shop. Although he smiled at first, he looked around nervously and acted strangely. When Anna was helping another customer, she saw the man trying to lift a small but expensive painting without paying. Realizing that something was wrong, Anna made a quick decision to call Mr. Lewis. They worked together to stop the man, who turned out to be a thief. After the incident, the police arrived and praised Anna for her quick thinking and courage. They explained that stealing is a serious crime, and they were glad Anna acted so fast. Later, Mr. Lewis told Anna that she had done an excellent job and that her knowledge and bravery were impressive. Although the situation was scary, Anna felt proud of herself and knew she had made a positive difference. She continues to work hard at the shop, feeling even more motivated to learn and grow each day.",

      "passage": "Many ancient buildings around the world show how creative and skilled architects were in the past. For example, the Great Pyramid of Giza, which is located in Egypt, has stood for thousands of years and remains one of the wonders of the ancient world. It has a narrow entrance that leads to many hidden rooms, which were carefully designed to protect treasures. The architects had to manage the construction with great care, as they did not have modern tools to help them. At the top of the pyramid, there was once a shiny stone that reflected sunlight so brightly that it could be seen from far away. In ancient Greece, architects built the Parthenon, which is a temple dedicated to the goddess Athena. This temple was constructed on a high level of ground to show its importance, and its design included many details that symbolized strength and beauty. Since there were no trucks or cranes in ancient times, materials like stone had to be sailed across the sea, and workers had to lift heavy blocks using simple tools. Unlike modern architects, who sometimes get ideas from novels, ancient architects focused on making buildings that were strong and long-lasting. These incredible structures teach us about the creativity and intelligence of ancient people, whose designs continue to inspire us today.",

      "passage": "Architecture is a way to express ideas and culture. In different regions of the world, buildings often have unique shapes and designs, which reflect the traditions of their people. For example, in Egypt, the pyramids are shaped like triangles and are signs of the pharaohs’ power and greatness. In Japan, people often build houses with wooden structures that can move slightly during earthquakes, which shows a strong sense of safety and preparation. Sometimes, buildings are created to celebrate important events or achievements. The Eiffel Tower in France, which was built during a world fair, marks the birth of modern engineering and has become a global symbol of innovation. Architects often suggest ideas that are both creative and practical, aiming to meet the needs of the people who will use their buildings. For instance, they might design a school where children can learn towards a brighter future, or a hospital that brings comfort to patients while also being energy-efficient. Many architects wish to create places where people feel happy, safe, and inspired. When you look at a building, it feels like it has its own voice, telling the story of why it was built and who it was built for. This is why architecture is so important; it connects us to the past, the present, and the future.",

      "passage": "In ancient times, ceremonies were a way to celebrate important events and honor gods or rulers. For example, in Greece, people organized classical festivals to honor Zeus, the king of the gods, because they believed these ceremonies brought them closer to the divine. These festivals included grand arrangements of food, music, and athletic games, which attracted people from far and wide. Winners of the games were awarded olive wreaths, which symbolized victory and respect, while participants felt proud to compete in honor of their gods. Invitations were often sent to noble families and rulers from other regions, inviting them to join the celebration and strengthen political ties. In Egypt, ceremonies for the coronation of a new king or queen were equally impressive, as they included prayers to the gods and a procession where the king or queen was carried through the streets to show their connection to the divine. The arrangement of these events required careful planning to ensure everything went smoothly, since any mistake could be seen as a sign of disrespect to the gods. People believed that celebrating these moments not only brought blessings from the gods but also strengthened the bond between rulers and their people. Even today, modern ceremonies, which often reflect the traditions of ancient times, remind us of the importance of celebration and community.",

      "passage": "Traditional gatherings have been an important part of many cultures for centuries. These events often take place in special locations, such as a church or a palace, where people come together to celebrate or honor traditions that have been passed down through generations. For example, weddings in many countries are held in churches, where close family members and friends gather to support the couple, and the atmosphere is often filled with joy and respect. Before the ceremony begins, it is common for people to follow formal rules, such as dressing in traditional clothes and behaving politely, which show their respect for the event. In some cultures, traditional music is played during these events, and listeners are expected to pay attention while remaining quiet. Formal speeches may also be given by family members or friends, who often share their thoughts about the importance of the occasion and the traditions being followed. Although fewer than 50 percent of people in some regions follow these traditions as strictly as before, the value of these gatherings remains strong because they bring people close to one another. Whether in a palace, a church, or a simple home, these gatherings remind us of the importance of community, respect, and celebrating our shared history.",

When you look in a mirror, it shows you your reflection exactly as it is, which helps you see yourself clearly. If you smile, the mirror smiles back, but if you frown, it does the same, showing how life often reflects our actions. This is just like how people behave towards us in real life: if we are kind and polite, they will usually respond with kindness, but if we are rude, they might act against us. A mirror doesn’t allow you to lie about how you look, reminding us that we should be honest about our actions and words. Actually, being honest and kind is one of the most important lessons in life, because it helps us build good relationships with others. In some situations, you need to be careful about how you behave, especially if you are providing a service to others, since your behavior can affect how people see you. For example, a good waiter is able to stay calm and polite, even if a customer is upset, which not only helps solve problems but also shows professionalism. Life, like a mirror, reflects what you give it, so if you take care of others, they will take care of you in return.",

For some people, an ideal day includes time to do something they care about, such as reading, exercising, or spending time with family, which helps them feel connected and happy. Others may dream of a day full of exciting or even crazy adventures, where they feel like they belong in the moment and can forget their daily worries. The character of a person often influences what they see as an ideal day, because someone who enjoys quiet moments may prefer a calm day, while someone adventurous might want something more thrilling. Fortunately, we don’t need everything to be perfect to enjoy the day. What matters most is feeling grateful and being able to appreciate the small things, like a smile from a friend or the beauty of nature, which can make even an ordinary day feel special. While life can certainly be challenging at times, having a positive attitude helps us create moments of joy that last forever. So, whether your ideal day is calm and peaceful or extremely busy and exciting, the key is to find joy in the moment and create memories you can cherish for a lifetime.",

At school, she loves her science class the most because she can identify how things work in the natural world. During lunch, Emily spends time with her friends. They prefer an informal setting, so they often sit under a lovely tree in the schoolyard. After school, Emily likes to relax a little. She sometimes feels lazy, but she knows she needs to complete her chores. In the evening, Emily helps her mother with cooking. They talk about the day while preparing a meal with fresh material from the garden. Emily also enjoys reading books. Her favorite stories are about characters who are brave and clever. On weekends, Emily is likely to meet her friends at the park. They talk, laugh, and imagine their futures. Emily dreams of becoming a doctor, while her best friend plans to marry and travel the world. No matter what they choose, they believe even the least exciting days can be special if spent with people they love.",

The island was quiet and peaceful, and we felt safe exploring its beaches and forests. The hotel we chose had a friendly owner who welcomed us warmly. It wasn’t a luxury hotel, but it met all the standard needs for a comfortable stay. Every morning, we enjoyed a regular breakfast of fresh fruit and bread while sitting quietly by the sea. One of the highlights of the trip was kayaking. We paddled among the calm, blue waters, surrounded by beautiful fish and coral. In the evenings, we talked about our day and felt satisfied with all the fun and relaxation. My favorite part was meeting a group of tourists from the United States. They shared stories about their home, and we exchanged ideas about the best travel destinations. This vacation showed me how wonderful it is to connect with nature and people from different places.",

Normally, I depend on my phone for everything—checking the weather, chatting with friends, and even reading the latest news about my favorite celebrity. Without my phone, I started the day with a book. It was a work of fiction about a boy who climbs a high mountain to find treasure. Reading was a good way to relax, and I found it very helpful to focus on something other than screens. Later, I went for a walk in the park. I noticed small features of nature, like the colorful leaves and the sound of birds, which I usually miss. In the afternoon, I helped my mom bake a cake. We laughed when we accidentally added too much butter, making it a little too fat! At the end of the day, I realized that while phones are helpful, it’s good to take a break sometimes and enjoy life offline.",

      "passage": "Recycling is an important way for every individual to help the environment. When we recycle, we reduce waste and give old materials a new purpose. For example, a businessman might recycle paper from his office to benefit the planet. Recycling can also protect nature. It prevents pollution that harms animals and even damages human skin through chemicals in the air or water. Recycling is simple, but it requires effort. Unlike the usual habits of throwing everything away, it encourages people to be active in making a difference. A good recipe for success is to start small—perhaps by recycling cans or bottles—and slowly build better habits. Communities can lock in these habits by providing bins and making it easy for people to recycle. The benefits of recycling go beyond the environment. It can save energy and create jobs, supporting a better lifestyle for everyone. Whether you are a student, a parent, or a worker, recycling is a step toward a healthier and cleaner world.",

We packed blankets, food, and even a small bottle of soap to wash our hands before eating. When we arrived, we found a spot near the water where the waves were calm and peaceful. While exploring the area, we saw some wild animals, including birds and small crabs. My dad reminded us to protect nature by not leaving any trash behind. He said pollution can destroy the beautiful environment and harm animals. We also used bug spray to keep insects away and avoid any bites that could spread disease. During lunch, we enjoyed sandwiches and fresh fruit while listening to the sound of the waves. It was a relaxing and fun day, and we promised to take care of the coast so future picnics could be just as enjoyable.",

The Art Club helps students look at the world creatively by teaching them how to draw and paint. In the Cooking Club, we learn how to bake cakes and cook meals. Last week, we used the school oven to bake cookies, and everyone enjoyed them. The Debate Club focuses on improving speaking skills and confidence. Members of this club practice debating topics, such as whether schools should contain more outdoor activities. There is even a Travel Club that dreams about visiting places, including how airlines work to bring people to exciting destinations. School clubs not only make learning fun but also help students make friends and explore their interests.",

We were surprised to see a big advertising board with a map of all the animal enclosures. Our first stop was the underground reptile house, where we saw snakes and lizards. My younger brother loved the lion exhibit the most, while I enjoyed watching the elephants. We noticed that the zoo had set up special bins for rubbish to keep the area clean. They even had a sign asking visitors to refuse plastic bags and use eco-friendly options instead. Near the food court, a survey was being conducted to ask visitors about their favorite animals. The zookeepers also showed us how they wash and feed the animals every day. Before leaving, we visited the gift shop, where my mom paid in cash for a T-shirt with a tiger design. My dad, on the other hand, decided to buy a book about animals using his credit card. As we walked back to the car, my brother got to ride in a stroller with big wheels because he was tired. It was a fun and educational day for all of us.",
